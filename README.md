If you feel like my tool helped and you want to give a few bucks for it : https://ko-fi.com/lolarchiver# (it's not expected, I made this script because other services made people pay when it can be done for free without any additionnal cost, but I like if people have the choice to pay for it)

# Disclaimer

It should work just fine, I regularly use the script myself, but if anything wrong happens I am not taking any responsibility. Do not use this script if the 0.1% possible failure scares you.

# Prerequisites

I use Google Chrome. I don't know if it will work elsewhere. It probably will, but if it doesn't, just try on Chrome.

## Text Tutorial

- Go to https://twitter.com/
- Open the DevTools by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I
- Click on Network tab in the DevTools console
  - If requests are not being recorded, press CTRL + E and wait 5 seconds
- You should now have something like this : ![ULXBFrT](https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets/assets/43145883/f784c575-efbb-42a2-a217-4700ba715b7e)
- Click on Fetch/XHR : ![KtZYL0L](https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets/assets/43145883/f0cdb3e8-f9ee-4ce3-ac39-c0a463c00bf6)
- Now click on any request in the results, and look for the authorization/X-Client-Transaction-Id/X-Client-Uuid values, as in screenshot: ![pxN8nth](https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets/assets/43145883/8f6b0123-2f51-41da-a234-255c5bbb5589)
- Now replace the values in the .js from this repository of the according variables, by the values of the three variables you found, here is an example of how it should look in the end : ![E0M6Bf9](https://github.com/teisseire117/DeleteTweets/assets/43145883/bac5806b-9c76-4018-b2c0-55fb9080e715)

## Filtering
- You can filter which tweets to delete by editing the `delete_options` variable. For now you can decide to remove tweet that contain a certain keyword. For example if you want to delete tweets that contain the word "Hi" or "Hello"(case sensitive), change the variable to look like that :
```
var delete_options = {
	"delete_message_with_url_only":false,
	"match_any_keywords":["Hi", "Hello"]
}
```
- You can also choose to remove tweets only if they contain a link in them. Just change `delete_message_with_url_only` to `true`. You can combine this option with the keywords option.
- Edit 25/08/2023, you can now add tweet ids that you want to keep, so they won't get removed. It's the "tweets_to_ignore" property in the delete_options variable. Just add the tweet id in the array
- Edit 29/08/2023, you can now choose to also unretweet or not, by changing the "unretweet" property in the delete_options variable. Set it to true if you want to unretweet. It combines with the other filters.

Now copy/paste the script in the console, press Enter, and wait for the deletion to complete. It should write "DELETION COMPLETE" in the console when it's over.
When it's over, launch the script a second time, there sometime are a few leftovers.

I allow tickets in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· but prefer English if you can speak it, so everyone can understand.


# FAQ

## Do I need to include the Bearer part of the authorization key ?
Yes

## I can't find X-Client-Transaction-Id/X-Client-Uuid/authorization
In the request list, search for requests named `client_event.json`, they are the more frequent ones, and they always contain the tokens you need
